# Drink Finder

## MVP

    - Generate multiple choice list of cocktails characteristics
    - User can select as many items as they want
    - On submit, a list of drinks matching the user's specifications will appear
    - Each drink will have a drop down menu for the full recipe and methods for making the cocktail
    - App will also have a surprise me feature that randomly generates a drink

## Specifications

    - Home page will be a set of questions with multiple choice answers e.g. 'What alcohol would you prefer?' 'Would you like a garnish?'
    - Each questions will have a, for example 'no garnish' or 'no whiskey' choice
    - Questions without a selection will not add a filter based on that category
    - Next to the submit button will also be a surprise me button that randomly generates a list of 5 drinks
    - On submit, a list of 5 drinks based on the user's specifications will appear
    - User will be able to select a drop down menus, in which are the recipes and building methods for each drinks
    - Possibly add in a bookmark or favorites page if I can get to it and maybe a drink history


## Challenges

    - Filtering by the recipes might be difficult if the alcohols, for example, are not specified with the same identifiers
